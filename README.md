**What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?**

In these projects, the main problem was to develop a course planner program that could load and manage course data, display course information, and handle user interactions effectively. The goal was to provide a tool that assists in managing course information for an educational institution's advising program.

**How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.**

I approached the problem by designing a C++ program that utilized three different data structures (vector, hash table, and binary tree) to store and manage course information. Data structures are crucial because they determine how data is stored, organized, and accessed efficiently. Each data structure has its strengths and weaknesses, affecting factors like runtime efficiency and memory usage. Understanding data structures allowed me to choose the most suitable one based on the requirements of the project.

**How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?**

During the projects, I faced challenges in understanding the intricacies of each data structure and their corresponding algorithms. I overcame these challenges by thoroughly studying relevant resources, consulting documentation, and experimenting with code to grasp how each data structure works. Additionally, I reached out to online programming communities and forums to seek assistance when faced with specific issues or uncertainties.

**How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?**

These projects expanded my understanding of software design by emphasizing the importance of selecting the right data structure for specific tasks. I learned to analyze the project requirements and consider factors like runtime complexity and memory usage when making design decisions. This experience highlighted the significance of modular design, encapsulation, and following best practices for code organization, leading to more structured and manageable codebases.

**How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?**

Through these projects, I developed a stronger focus on writing maintainable, readable, and adaptable code. I implemented meaningful class structures, followed naming conventions, and utilized comments to enhance code readability. By abstracting functionality into classes and functions, I created modular and reusable code segments that are easier to maintain and adapt for future changes. Additionally, I gained insight into the importance of code comments and documentation to improve codebase understanding for myself and potential collaborators.
